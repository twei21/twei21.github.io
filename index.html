<h1>Tony Wei</h1>

<p>I am a student who study at Ross for 6 months. I am in 9th Grade and I am 15 years old.I am from Shanghai China. I got a lot of habit in daily life. I started learning robotics when I was in 2nd grade. I have attended a lot of robotic competitions and last year me and my team went to LA to attend the <a href="http://en.wercontest.org/">WER</a>（World Education Robot Competition）. We had to design a robot that could lift a heavy object to balance a scale.
